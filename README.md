Title: Performance Evaluation of Bowlers in Cricket.

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to develop an application for evaluating the performance of bowlers with different input statistics.

Technologies: R Programming Language.

Tools & Platform: R studio.

Functionality : The application has been implemented for calculating the performance of bowlers in graphs from the given different input statistics like Number of wickets taken, runs vs wickets etc.,

The following goals have been achieved by the above application:

● The application runs in R programming language which outputs the graphical data that compares the efficiency of different players.
● The application accepts input in a .excel file or.csv file and converts the data into a two dimensional array and outputs the results in graphs.

Achievements: 
- Statistics of the players can be achieved that can be compared with all the other players which makes the job easy for selectors.
